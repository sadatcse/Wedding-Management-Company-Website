        "question": "How soon should you book your Bangladesh wedding day?",
        "answer": "To ensure a seamless and unforgettable wedding day in Bangladesh, it's advisable to book your wedding 1-6 months in advance of your desired date. This timeframe is ideal for several reasons. Firstly, it secures the best venues, ensuring that you have access to the most enchanting locations, especially if your wedding is set outside Dhaka, where many of our unique venues are situated. Furthermore, Bangladesh has become a prominent tourist destination, making it essential to plan well ahead. Many of our weddings take place in serene countryside locations, and during the high season (May-August), securing these venues becomes increasingly challenging if you wait less than a year. By booking your wedding with us in advance, you not only secure your preferred date and venue but also allow us ample time to curate a personalized and memorable wedding experience that aligns perfectly with your dreams."
